\section{Related work}

The study of gesture recognition with a presentation viewer application was shown in \cite{Rehm}. They show an active region for starting and ending gesture interaction. Also, they point out that gestures can be useful in crowded or noisy situations, such as in a stock exchange or manufacturing environment. Head and hand gestures have been used for limited interactions as demonstrated in by Keates et al. \cite{Rehm}. They discussed the problem of learning gestures and showed the importance of customization. Kurze et al. \cite{SGSAyman} presented personalization of multi-modal applications as a design approach. They focus on implicit and explicit customization of systems according to a user's preferences. Kawsar et al. \cite{SGSAyman} presented customizing the proactive applications preferences in a ubiquitous environment. They present customization in many levels of artifact, action, interaction, and timing preferences.
