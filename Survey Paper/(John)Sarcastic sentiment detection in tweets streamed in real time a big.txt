In this paper the author discussed how it's hard for humans to detect sarcastic comments and the amount
of data is huge for manual detection. The author proposed a framework that recieve tweets
and process them to identify sarcastic comments. The hadoop-based framework allows user to 
get and save tweets and process them. They used Twitter streaming API(twitter4j) to retieve
tweets. They used sentiment analysis to classify the tweets as negative, positive or neutral.
 The tweets pass through MapReduce functions for sentiemnt classification.
they used parts-of-speach(POS) for deviding sentences into words and assign appropriate information
 and they used parsing to analyze grammatical structure. Finally, they used 6 algorithms and achieved
0.97 precision when the combined 3 of them. They are: Parsed based lexicon generation algorithm(PBLGA),
Interjection word start(IWS),Postive sentiment with antonym pair(PSWAP).
